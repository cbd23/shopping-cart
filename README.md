### Introduction

Feel free to explore the products available in this **Online Store App** that I build using **React**.

Go back and forth by using the dots under the carousel slider and hover it to pause the slides if you want to look at a product for a few seconds.

Mark products as favorite or add them to your cart. You can remove them anytime, either from the product page or directly from cart.

See the products that you added and their price. Click on a product to go on their page one more time, remove it from the cart or even place an order that you don't have to pay for, since it will never be shipped to you.

The TOTAL updates as you add/remove items to/from the shopping cart.

A message will be displayed as soon as you're trying to access a URL that doesn't exist + a button that will help you go back to Homepage.

### Technologies

**React Router**, **PropTypes** and **CSS Modules** are only some of the things that I used for the first time while building this app. 
I also created my own JSON file in order to fetch data about the products instead of using an API, since I wanted it to have certain categories and uniformity in the product images.

Other technologies that I used:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **REACT**
- **Vite** as local development server 
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **npm** for dependency management
